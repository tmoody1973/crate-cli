> The story of a radio veteran who built the tool he always needed.

## The Narrative

The story isn't "developer builds CLI tool." The story is:

**A public radio professional with 20+ years in music — not a traditional engineer — built the only AI agent for music research because nobody else understood what music professionals actually need.**

This is the angle that cuts through the noise. The AI/dev community sees hundreds of tools. They've never seen one built by someone who has:
- Hosted a nationally syndicated music show for 20 years
- Contributed to NPR Music and judged the Tiny Desk Contest
- Launched a digital media platform celebrating Black culture
- Been named one of Milwaukee's 30 people shaping the future
- Served 14 years as a U.S. Army Reserves officer
- Holds an architecture degree from Howard University

The credibility isn't in the code — it's in the **domain expertise** behind the code.

### Launch Week Thread (Pin this)

**Post 1 — The Hook:**
```
I've been hosting a nationally syndicated music show for 20 years.

I've played records by Lianne La Havas, Kamasi Washington, and The Internet before anyone else.

I've contributed to NPR Music and judged the Tiny Desk Contest.

And I just built an AI agent. Here's why.
```

**Post 2 — The Problem:**
```
After 20 years in radio, I know how music research actually works.

You don't Google it. You read reviews. You follow the thread from one artist to the next. You cross-reference databases. You call other DJs.

No AI tool does this. ChatGPT guesses. Spotify follows the crowd.

So I built one that does.
```

**Post 3 — What It Is:**
```
Crate is the only AI agent built for music research.

92 tools. 17 data sources. Influence tracing backed by Harvard research.

Ask it anything in plain English. It searches MusicBrainz, Discogs, Bandcamp, Genius, Last.fm, and 12 more — cites every claim, verifies every track.

It even plays music right in the terminal.
```

**Post 4 — The Credibility:**
```
The influence tracing system is built on methodology from the Harvard Data Science Review.

It doesn't guess who influenced who. It searches 26 music publications — Pitchfork, The Wire, Resident Advisor, The Guardian — and shows you the exact review.

Publication. Critic. Date. URL. Click through and read it yourself.
```

**Post 5 — The "Non-Technical" Angle:**
```
I'm not a traditional engineer.

I'm an architect from Howard University who became a radio host who became a digital director who learned to code.

I built Crate with Claude as my pair programmer. The AI helped me write the tool. Now the tool helps everyone research music.

That's the future: domain experts building their own tools.
```

**Post 6 — The Install:**
```
One command:

npm install -g crate-cli

Open source. MIT licensed. The setup wizard walks you through everything.

I built this for radio hosts, DJs, critics, collectors, and anyone who thinks about music harder than the algorithm does.

crate-cli.dev
```

### Ongoing Post Templates

#### Build in Public (2-3x/week)

```
Today I shipped [feature].

The reason: [20-year radio insight that explains why this matters].

What I learned: [honest technical takeaway from a non-traditional builder].
```

```
Real conversation with Crate just now:

"Trace the influence from [Artist A] to [Artist B]"

[Screenshot of terminal showing the result]

Every hop cited. Every review linked. This is what 26 publications of evidence looks like.
```

```
Features I'm building next, ranked by what 20 years of radio tells me matters most:

1. [Feature] — because [radio insight]
2. [Feature] — because [radio insight]
3. [Feature] — because [radio insight]

What would you add?
```

#### Music Knowledge (2x/week)

```
Thing I know from 20 years in radio that no algorithm will ever figure out:

[Specific music insight — an influence connection, a production credit, a genre lineage, a scene connection]

This is why I built Crate. The knowledge lives in reviews, not in listening data.
```

```
[Artist] is having a moment right now.

But the real story is the lineage:
[Artist A] → [Artist B] → [Artist C] → [Current Artist]

I traced this in Crate. Here are the reviews that prove it.

[Screenshot]
```

```
On this week's Rhythm Lab Radio, I played [track].

Here's what Crate found when I asked about the producer:
- [MusicBrainz credit]
- [Discogs pressing info]
- [Genius annotation]
- [Bandcamp release]

4 sources, one question, zero hallucination.
```

#### Origin Story (1x/week)

```
People ask how a radio host ended up building a CLI tool.

Short version: I've been doing music research manually for 20 years. I finally automated it.

Long version: [Thread about the journey from radio → digital → code → AI]
```

```
In 2005 I launched Rhythm Lab Radio on Minnesota Public Radio.

In 2022 I launched HYFIN to celebrate Black culture through digital media.

In 2026 I launched Crate — the AI agent I wish I'd had for the last 20 years.

The common thread: using technology to surface music and culture that algorithms miss.
```

```
Howard University taught me architecture. The Army taught me leadership. Radio taught me curation.

Building Crate taught me that domain expertise beats engineering credentials every single time.

The best tools are built by the people who actually need them.
```

#### Community & Culture (1x/week)

```
HYFIN exists because Black music is more than what streaming algorithms surface.

Crate exists because music research is more than what ChatGPT remembers.

Same mission, different tool: amplify what's real, cite what's true, never hallucinate.
```

```
I work at a public radio station. Not a YC startup. Not a FAANG company.

But I've spent 20 years building digital products, launching platforms, and now building AI tools.

The future of AI isn't just Silicon Valley. It's domain experts everywhere building what they need.
```

### Launch Post (LinkedIn)

```
I just shipped something I've been thinking about for 20 years.

Crate is an AI agent for music research. Not music creation — music knowledge.

Here's why it matters:

I've hosted Rhythm Lab Radio, a nationally syndicated music show, since 2005. I've contributed to NPR Music. I've programmed HYFIN, a digital platform celebrating Black culture. For two decades, music research has been my daily work.

And it's always been manual. Cross-referencing MusicBrainz for credits. Searching Discogs for pressings. Reading Pitchfork reviews to trace who influenced who. Checking Bandcamp for independent releases. No single tool connects these sources.

ChatGPT can't do this. It guesses from training data and hallucinates track names. Spotify's algorithm follows the crowd — it tells you what's popular, not what's influential.

So I built Crate. The only agentic AI tool built specifically for music research.

92 tools across 17 data sources. Influence tracing backed by methodology from the Harvard Data Science Review. Every claim cited with publication, critic, date, and URL. Every track verified against real databases before inclusion.

I'm not a traditional engineer. I'm an architect from Howard University who became a radio host who became a digital strategist who learned to build. I built Crate with AI as my pair programmer — using Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK to orchestrate the research workflow I've done manually for 20 years.

That's the insight I want to share with this community: the most impactful AI tools won't come from engineers guessing what industries need. They'll come from domain experts who finally have the tools to build what they've always wanted.

One command to try it:
npm install -g crate-cli

Open source. MIT licensed. Built by a radio host for anyone who thinks about music harder than the algorithm does.

#### "Domain Expert Builder" Posts

```
Controversial take: The best AI tools in 2026 won't come from AI companies.

They'll come from domain experts — doctors, journalists, architects, radio hosts — who understand a problem deeply enough to know what the right tool looks like.

I spent 20 years researching music manually. Now I have an AI agent that does it in seconds. Not because I'm a great engineer — but because I knew exactly what "good research" looks like in this domain.

What domain expertise do you have that's waiting to become a tool?
```

```
My path to building an AI product:

1996: Architecture degree from Howard University
1999: Started volunteering at community radio
2005: Launched Rhythm Lab Radio on NPR
2006: Joined 88Nine Radio Milwaukee
2018: Created 88Nine Labs for underrepresented communities in tech
2022: Launched HYFIN — digital platform for Black culture
2026: Shipped Crate — AI agent for music research

Not a linear path. But every step taught me something about the intersection of technology, culture, and community that made this possible.

The lesson: your career doesn't have to look like everyone else's to end up somewhere meaningful.
```

#### AI + Music Industry Posts

```
Spotify's recommendation algorithm processes 600 million users' listening data to suggest what you should hear next.

Crate reads 26 music publications and traces influence through documented reviews written by professional critics.

One follows the crowd. The other follows the experts.

Both have value. But if you want to understand WHY artists connect — not just THAT they're related — you need the reviews, not the data.

This is why I built Crate: crate-cli.dev
```

```
The music industry has an AI problem.

Not the "AI is replacing musicians" problem — the information problem.

Music metadata is scattered across 17+ databases. Artist relationships are documented in reviews nobody reads anymore. Genre classification is a mess. Production credits are incomplete.

The AI opportunity isn't generating music. It's organizing the knowledge that already exists.

That's what Crate does. And I think it's just the beginning of domain-specific AI agents transforming how industries actually work.
```

#### Product Milestone Posts

```
Crate just hit [milestone].

For context: this started as a personal tool I built because I was tired of manually cross-referencing MusicBrainz and Discogs while prepping Rhythm Lab Radio every week.

Now it has [X] tools across [Y] sources, and [use case that resonates].

The best products start as tools you build for yourself.

Here's what I'm building next: [upcoming feature and why it matters]
